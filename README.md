# wfutemplates

The goal of `wfutemplates` is to codify some commonly used templates at
WFU and make report generation easier while adhering to a common visual
identity. This package is largely inspired by the `memor`
[package](https://github.com/hebrewseniorlife/memor) with slowly
evolving tweaks.

This package has a lot of the **Wake Forest University** logos.

## Installation

You can install the released version of wfutemplates from
[github](https://github.com) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("medewitt/wfutemplates")
```
